# Hungergames-Plugin
An open-source minecraft hungergames plugin

I began creating this plugin a few years ago.
It never got completed so I am setting out to try again.
It is all written in Java using the Eclipse IDE.
I am making this plugin because I feel that the hungergames
plugins that exist just dont have what I am looking for.
Even if you down use this plugin directly, there is something to learn
from looking at the code. If for example you are buliding your own but you
don't know how you are going to add and manage the games chests you can
find how in my code!
